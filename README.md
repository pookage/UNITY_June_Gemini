# June Project : Gemini

June 2018's coding project - a twin-stick style shooter of some sort.

## Notes

In sticking with my idea of avoiding violence-first gameplay; I'm thinking that, while shooting will be part of the gameplay, killing enemies will deduct points rather than add them - making killing somewhat of a noobie mistake rather than a veteran skill.
